#### Introduction

This slide pack has been streamlined to help users to easily access the most important information. This change took effect as of June 2024 data. As part of this change we have also sought to make the slides more useful by making the following changes:

-   Swapping from scheduled data (the month the dentist claimed for payment following a finished course of treatment) to calendar month data (the month the course of treatment finished). This change better reflects the activity of dentists.
-   Including only GDS/PDS/PDS+ contracts where total contracted UDAs \>100. This means contracts with low UDA targets are excluded because they are usually not monitored against UDA delivery.
-   The data is available in an Excel file available alongside this pack.

This pack will continue to evolve and change, any questions/comments should be directed to [england.primarycare.phodsdata@nhs.net](mailto:england.primarycare.phodsdata@nhs.net)

-   For the current financial year, monthly performance is shown. For the previous financial years, annual average performance is shown.
